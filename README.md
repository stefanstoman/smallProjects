# smallProjects

Just a repository for small practice projects and games.
This repository contains the meagre efforts in my quest towards becoming a reasonable programmer.
Getting better in small steps.
If there is something you can take from here to learn and help yourself, by all means do so!
It would be my tremendous honor.
